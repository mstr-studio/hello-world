# hello-world

Welcome!

My name is Matt and I'm about to begin my journey with programming well over a decade after graduating from college.
I hope this to be a wonderful adventure that will last a lifetime.
At first, I'd like to focus mainly on C# and RESTful Web services, but these are not my only areas of interest, so I'm totally opened to whatever the future has in stock for me.

Cheers!
